# My Experience

Coding this project was interesting and enjoyable, it also made me realize a few things.  

A centralized state management is absolutely necessary, even if a project may seem like it's really little and using tools like Redux would not be worth it. I used Context API and useState hook in this case and even thought they do the job, I see how other tools could improve the quality of my code by making it more clean, straightforward and scalable.
